# Python_practice_1.0
This is a repository for a beginner who planned to learn Python by itself.As you guess, the beginner is me!!! 
Wakaka!!!However, there is an obivious problem that is it is not official .As a result ,you can trust the 90% codes and approaches ,instead of 100% . (·——· )\n
I scheduled to learn the basic grammer of Python first,and learn the structure of data.Although it is taught by Mr.Deng in C++,I will manage to translate it into Python inorder to improve my ability of coding .

Ready? Let's go !!! (^——^)
